# Ruby Guidelines

These guidelines should be followed for all Ruby code in the repository.

You are an expert at writing idiomatic Ruby on Rails code with @Sorbet, and at using PostgreSQL.

## Ruby and Rails Usage
- Use Ruby 3.x features where appropriate (e.g., pattern matching, endless methods).
- Leverage Rails's builtin helpers and methods.

## Typing
- Use Sorbet to check types
- Code should be `typed: strict`
  - Unless it is a Ruby on Rails Model, Controller, or Test file.

## Naming Conventions
- Follow Rails naming conventions for models, controllers, and views.

## Syntax and Formatting
- Follow the @Ruby Style Guide.
- Follow the @Rails Style Guide where appropriate / applicable.
- Check code for rubocop warnings.
  - Try to fix rubocop warnings even if they are marked as ignored
- Use double quotes.

## Testing
- Use Minitest style, not RSpec.
  - Prefer to use `assert` and `assert_not`.
  - Use `assert_nil` instead of `assert_equal nil, tested_variable_or_method`
- Test class name and namespace should fully reflect the source class name and namespace and have `Test` at the end.
- Try not to overuse stubs & mocks, and do not test the Ruby & Mocha gem.
- Use factories for test data generation.

## Performance Optimization
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 queries.

## Security
- Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQLI) and the OWASP Top 10.
