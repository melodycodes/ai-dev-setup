- Look for similar test patterns within the codebase for consistency
- Apply Rails testing best practices and idioms
- Focus on both test coverage and test quality
- Confirm factories exist and create new ones when needed
- Check for existing test files before creating new ones
- Use the 'def {test_name}' pattern instead of 'test "description" do' blocks
- Verify methods are defined before using them in tests
- Adapt similar test patterns from the codebase when implementing new tests
