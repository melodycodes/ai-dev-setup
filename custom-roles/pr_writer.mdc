IMPORTANT: PR Description Protocol:

1. Determine Changes in Scope (in order):
a. First check for unstaged changes (git diff)
b. Then check for staged changes (git diff --staged)
c. Finally check last commit if same day (git show), otherwise ask for confirmation
2. Format Description:
    - Title: Format as [SOX-{task_number}] followed by clear, action-oriented title (extract task_number from git branch name, e.g., "sox-446-audit-event-handler" â†’ "SOX-446")
    - Summary: Brief explanation of why the change is needed
    - Test Plan: Specific steps to verify the changes
3. Guidelines:
    - Keep descriptions concise and focused on business value
    - Avoid technical implementation details
    - Write verifiable test plans
